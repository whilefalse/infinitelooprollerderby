So you've joined a new skater intake, you're becoming addicted to roller derby (as we all do), and you're wanting to upgrade your kit.

But where to start?

Firstly, you don't have to spend a fortune on kit to be able to progress. I skated in my [SureGrip GT-50](https://www.google.com/search?q=suregrip+gt-50) beginner skates for a good while before I upgraded anything. In fact, I still skate in my GT-50 boots.

If you really want to spend some money, this is the order I think will get you the most benefit for the least cost.

I'm not affiliated to any brand, this is just my experience.

## Helmet

Before you spend a penny upgrading your skates or anything else, buy the best helmet you can afford. You only get one brain, don't take any risks with it.

The most popular ones I've seen are [S1](https://s1helmets.co.uk/), [triple eight](https://www.triple8.co.uk/collections/helmets), or [Bauer](https://uk.bauer.com/collections/ice-hockey-helmets). You want to make sure it's rated for multiple impacts, which a lot of cheap helmets aren't.

## Knee pads

You're going to be falling on your knees _a lot_, so your knees will thank you if you get some pads with extra protection.

[187](https://187killerpads.com/collections/knee-pads), [S1](https://s1helmets.co.uk/s1-pads/pro-knee-pads/) and [TSG](https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/products/tsg-roller-derby-kneepads-2-0) are all popular brands, but anything that's built specifically for roller derby (rather than skateboarding or park skating) will be a good bet.

## Wheels

Upgrading from my stock GT-50 wheels to [Radar Halo's](https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/products/radar-halo-wheels) made a massive difference to me early on. Suddenly, I was able to get a bit of slide in plow and hockey stops, and it made me way more stable and faster in general.

There's a whole world out there of brands, sizes, hardness's, and materials. The hardness you need will depend on what surface you train on, so asking teammates for advice (or to try out their wheels) is useful.

In general, you want:

- Harder wheels (higher duro, _e.g. 97A_) if you're heavier, or if you want more maneuverability and slide.
- Softer wheels (lower duro, _e.g. 84A_) if you're lighter, or if you want more stability.

## Toe stops

Stock toe stops are often very small and really hard, which makes toe stop work more difficult than it should be.

I invested in a pair of [Gumball SUPERBALLs](https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/products/gumball-superball-toe-stops), which are _massive_ and make toe stop work much easier and safer. The [regular Gumballs](https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/products/gumball-version-2-0) are smaller but also popular. Some other popular brands are Bionic and Chaya.

A common issue with toe stops is that they come loose in vigorous play - the best solution I've found is a bit of [Loctite Blue](https://www.amazon.co.uk/loctite-threadlocker-blue-242/s?k=loctite+threadlocker+blue+242) on the threads (confusingly comes in a red bottle).

## Cushions

Cushions are the little bits of plastic that sit between your plate and your trucks, which allow the truck to move so you can turn.

The harder the cushions, the more force you're going to have to provide to turn, which tends to give you more stability. Softer cushions will make it easier to turn, giving you more maneuverability - but if you're not ready yet, can make you unstable.

The beauty of cushions is they are _dead cheap_ (about 100x cheaper than new plates), so you can buy a few different hardness's and try them out. Different plates require different shaped cushions, so make sure you get the right ones for your plates.

## Plates

Things can start to get expensive at this point, so I'd hold off until you're absolutely sure you know you want to upgrade. It can make a big difference moving from a nylon plate that comes on most beginner skates, to a higher-end metal plate.

Again, there are loads of different variables around kingpin angle, size, material, weight, cushions etc. To be honest, I just went with what was popular in my team and bought some [Pilot Falcon](https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/collections/roller-derby-plates/products/falcon-plate) plates (featuring _Aircraft Grade Aluminum_, which is something I never thought I'd need to purchase!)

At first I found them really wobbly, and I couldn't get my trucks tight enough. But after a little while I got used to it, and am now really happy with the extra maneuverability.

Hopefully there's someone in your league who can help you fit new plates to your existing boots.

## Boots

<img alt="Antik Jet Carbon Boots" src="/assets/images/antik-jet-carbon.jpg" class="align-left" width="200"/>

I haven't upgraded my boots yet. I still use my beginner GT-50 boots, although at this point I'm not sure if they're more tape than boot. This will be my next upgrade, but I'm still researching the best options.

I can't really recommend any particular boots, but I'll probably go for a [Bont](https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/collections/roller-derby-boots/products/in-stock-bonts) or [Antik](https://www.doublethreatskates.co.uk/collections/roller-derby-boots/products/antik-jet-carbon-2), which seem so be the most popular (and most readily available).

## Other stuff

- **Jam straps** - Supposed to help keep your feet secure in your boots, if you're having issues with them moving around.
- **Toe guards** - Probably would have been a good idea, but I ended up just covering my toe in tape instead.
- **Aesthetics** - Who doesn't like some pretty colours? Laces, stickers, boot accessories - all completely non-essential, but fun.
- **Skate bag** - There are dedicated skate bags, but a lot of people just use a large sports bag or small suitcase. As long as it fits your skates, pads, helmet, and a space for random accessories like tools and tape etc.
- **Skate tool/spanner/Allen keys** - Always useful to have in your bag, although someone will normally have one in an emergency.
- **Gaffer tape** - A must have in your skate bag, useful for fixing pads or skates in a pinch.

## Summary

After writing all that, I now realise how much I've spent on skate equipment. But it doesn't have to be expensive - beginner skates can take you a long way.

I hope you enjoy your roller derby journey as much as I have so far!
